            <p>
                This generator creates names by intelligently combining letter "blocks" based on 
                configurable parameters. Using a sophisticated scoring system, it selects blocks 
                that work well together and match your desired characteristics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each generated name undergoes compatibility checks for pronunciation, 
                aesthetic appeal, and thematic consistency.
